# Smart Agriculture Project in West Africa - 6-Month Plan

This report outlines the 6-month strategic plan for deploying a precision farming MVP in West Africa, targeting 100 farmers across two partnered cooperatives.  The project is supported by a $50,000 grant.  Key challenges include equipment delivery delays, farmer training, and integrating satellite data.

**Goals:**

The project focuses on five key goals:

1. **Secure Equipment and Infrastructure (Months 1-2):**  This involves procuring and delivering all necessary hardware.  Milestones include placing equipment orders and ensuring timely delivery to both cooperatives.

2. **Develop and Test MVP (Months 1-3):**  This involves developing the core platform functionality, with alpha and beta releases, followed by thorough internal testing.

3. **Farmer Training and Onboarding (Months 3-5):** This involves comprehensive training for 100 farmers on platform usage and data interpretation.  The plan targets onboarding 50 farmers by month 4.

4. **Satellite Data Integration (Months 4-6):** This integrates satellite data for enhanced precision farming capabilities.  Key milestones include API integration and data visualization.

5. **MVP Deployment and Initial Data Collection (Months 5-6):** This final phase focuses on deploying the MVP to the onboarded farmers and starting data collection.

**Mitigation of Challenges:**

* **Equipment Delays:**  Proactive communication with suppliers and contingency planning are crucial to mitigate potential delays.
* **Farmer Training:**  A phased approach to training, involving smaller groups, will ensure effective knowledge transfer.
* **Satellite Data Integration:**  Early engagement with data providers will facilitate seamless integration.


This plan requires close collaboration between the Operations Manager, Lead Developer, Training Coordinator, Data Scientist, and Project Manager.  Regular progress monitoring is essential to address any emerging challenges and ensure successful project completion.
